# ACME Master Data

## ACME "Golden" records

Each type is assigned an ACME Type ID, and each instance of the type — i.e. an object — is assigned an ACME Object ID.

["Golden" records](../../faq#golden-records) (for objects which are maintained by different Services each of which handles specific subsets of attributes) are suggested by ACME-CS.

As a Master Data Source, ACME provides and keeps [**ACME "golden" records**](ops/masterds/acme_master_data#acme-golden-records) with verified and cleaned data to all services.
